# ACS_API_call
This code gives you a quick and easy intro API calls, specifically with American Community Survey (ACS) data (which can tell you some pretty cool stuff!)\
\
Census API.pdf is a document I complied of everything you need to know about making API calls for ACS--I learned the specifics of the Census API the hard way through reading ACS handbooks and such so I made it simple and accessible for you :)\
\
Note: I'm planning to make my code more efficient by using more loops, lists, defining a function, etc. so stay tuned!
